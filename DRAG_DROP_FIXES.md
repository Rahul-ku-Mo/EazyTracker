# Drag and Drop Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. React StrictMode Compatibility
- **Problem**: React Beautiful DnD has known issues with React 18's StrictMode
- **Solution**: Removed StrictMode from `main.tsx`
- **Impact**: Drag and drop now works properly without breaking after the first use

### 2. Optimistic Updates and Race Conditions
- **Problem**: Aggressive cache invalidation was causing drag state to be lost
- **Solution**: 
  - Improved optimistic update logic in mutations
  - Added delays before cache invalidation
  - Better error handling and rollback functionality

### 3. Order Calculation Precision
- **Problem**: Poor order calculation leading to conflicts
- **Solution**:
  - Use larger increments (1000, 500) for better precision
  - Detect when order differences are too small and recalculate
  - Better handling of empty columns and edge positions

### 4. Component Stability
- **Problem**: Components re-rendering unnecessarily during drag operations
- **Solution**:
  - Added defensive programming to check for required card properties
  - Improved key stability with prefixed keys (`card-${id}`, `item-${id}`)
  - Added `isDragDisabled={false}` explicitly
  - Better array handling with spread operators

## Key Changes Made

### 1. main.tsx
```typescript
// Removed StrictMode wrapper
createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <App />
)
```

### 2. ColumnBoard.tsx
- Enhanced mutation logic with better optimistic updates
- Improved handleDragEnd with validation and error handling
- Added race condition prevention

### 3. ListView/index.tsx  
- Similar improvements to ColumnBoard
- Better error handling for missing properties
- Improved order calculation logic
- Removed emerald drag styling and opacity changes
- Added minimum height for drop zones

### 4. CardsInColumn.tsx
- Added defensive programming for missing card properties
- Improved component stability with better key handling
- Added explicit style props for draggable elements
- Removed emerald theming from drag states
- Made drop zones full height with proper centering

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Basic Drag and Drop**: Cards should move smoothly between columns
2. **Refresh Test**: After page refresh, drag and drop should still work
3. **Multiple Operations**: Multiple drag operations should work without issues
4. **Error Resilience**: Invalid cards or missing properties shouldn't crash the app

## Troubleshooting

If drag and drop still doesn't work:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure all cards have valid `id` properties
3. Verify network requests for move operations are successful
4. Check if any other StrictMode wrappers exist in the component tree
5. Ensure React Beautiful DnD version is 13.1.1 (compatible with React 18)

## Known Limitations

- React Beautiful DnD is no longer actively maintained
- For future projects, consider alternatives like `@dnd-kit/core`
- Some performance optimizations may conflict with drag state management
